# Imrec
An Object Detection and Identification app that uses Convolutional Neural Network and Image artifacts to accurately Identify objects that are open or concealed in the Image.

It makes use of Microsoft's Computer vision server for Image database. The Neural Net is a part of Deep learning Algorithm. I use Caffe and Tensorflow for Network Design. For image Processing OpenCV is used.

Future Implementation of this app is on the way!!!
